# CLAUDE.md — AtlasBrief — AI Travel Briefing Room

This file is the canonical project briefing. **Future Claude must read this
first**, before touching any code. It captures the product vision, the brief,
the engineering rules, and the operating discipline.

If anything in conversation conflicts with this file, ask the user instead of
guessing.

---

## 1. Product vision

**AtlasBrief — AI Travel Briefing Room** is the Week 4 Smart Travel
Planner project (SE Factory AIE Bootcamp). The product is meant to feel
like a calm executive briefing, not a chat window — the user shows up
with a fuzzy travel idea and walks out with a defended recommendation.

---

## 2. Unique feature — the Decision Tension Board

Every recommendation surfaces four pieces, in this order:

1. **Dream Fit** — how well a destination matches the user's vibe.
   Computed from the **ML classifier** + **RAG** retrieval.
2. **Reality Pressure** — what live conditions (weather, flights, FX) say
   about going *right now*. Score is inverted: 100 = no pressure, 0 = high.
3. **Final Verdict** — one paragraph that **names the tradeoff** between
   Dream Fit and Reality Pressure. The agent must reason across tools, not
   concatenate them.
4. **Why Not the Obvious Pick?** — counterfactual card naming the
   destination most users would have guessed and why we did not pick it.

The schema for this board lives in `backend/app/schemas/trip_brief.py`. The
React UI lives in `frontend/src/App.tsx`. Do not redesign either without
explicit instruction.

## 3. Golden demo query

> "I have two weeks off in July and around $1,500. I want somewhere warm,
> not too touristy, and I like hiking. Where should I go, when should I
> book, and what should I expect?"

Every architectural choice is judged against whether it makes this query
work end-to-end, cleanly. Day 1's stub returns a Madeira-vs-Costa-Rica
payload as the hand-picked golden answer the real agent should be able to
recover.

## 4. Required Week 4 deliverables

The full mapping (with statuses and code-review notes) lives in
`REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`. The short version, which is the spec to defend
on Saturday:

### ML classifier
- Labels (exactly): **Adventure, Relaxation, Culture, Budget, Luxury, Family**.
- **100–200** hand-labeled destinations.
- **`sklearn.Pipeline`** with preprocessing inside (no leakage).
- **3 classifiers** compared with **k-fold cross-validation**.
- Report **accuracy + macro-F1** mean and std.
- Tune **at least one** model (e.g. `GridSearchCV`).
- Per-class metrics (no hiding rare classes behind averages).
- Append every experiment to **`results.csv`**.
- Save the winner with **joblib** as `model.joblib`.
- Pinned deps + fixed `random_state`.

### RAG
- **10–15 destinations**, **20–30 documents** (Wikivoyage / blogs / tourism boards).
- Embeddings stored in **Postgres + pgvector** (same DB as everything else).
- Justify chunk size + overlap + retrieval strategy in the README.
- Sanity-tested with hand-written queries before plugging into the agent.

### Agent — exactly 3 tools
1. `retrieve_destination_knowledge`
2. `classify_travel_style`
3. `fetch_live_conditions`

- Every tool input **and** output validated by Pydantic.
- **Explicit tool allowlist** — anything else is refused even if the model invents it.
- LangGraph or LangChain wiring.
- Genuine cross-tool synthesis (not concatenation).

### Two-model routing
- **Cheap model** (Haiku-class / gpt-4o-mini) for mechanical work
  (argument extraction, RAG query rewriting).
- **Strong model** (Sonnet/Opus class) for the final synthesis.
- **Token + cost logging** per step.

### Persistence
- Postgres + pgvector + SQLAlchemy 2.x **async**.
- Tables at minimum: `users`, `agent_runs`, `tool_calls`, `embeddings`.
- Alembic migrations.

### Auth
- Sign-up + login. Password hashing (bcrypt). JWT sessions.
- `current_user` FastAPI dependency on every protected route.

### Frontend
- React + Vite + TypeScript. Sign-in flow. Chat-style trip query.
- Tool-trace visibility — show what the agent did. Streaming optional.

### Webhook delivery
- Discord / Slack / email / Sheets — your choice.
- Timeout + retry-with-backoff + structured failure logging.
- **Webhook failure must NOT break the user-facing response.**

### Docker
- One-command stack via `docker compose up`.
- Backend, frontend, Postgres+pgvector containers.
- **Named volume** so embeddings survive restarts.

### Documentation
- `README.md` with: architecture diagram, dataset labeling rules, chunking
  rationale, model comparison table, per-query cost breakdown, LangSmith
  trace screenshot, optional extensions list.
- **3-minute demo video** of one end-to-end run.
- `CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md` updated after every major change.

## 5. Engineering rules

These are non-negotiable; the brief calls them out explicitly.

- **Small files, clear names.** No 600-line `main.py`. Split by concern:
  `routes/`, `schemas/`, `agent/`, `ml/`, `rag/`, `db/`, `auth/`,
  `webhooks/`.
- **No secrets committed.** `.env` is local-only. `.env.example` is the
  tracked template.
- **No scattered `os.getenv`.** All config enters through
  `backend/app/config.py` (pydantic-settings). Anywhere else uses
  `get_settings()`.
- **Async where appropriate.** FastAPI routes, tool functions, DB calls
  (SQLAlchemy 2.x async session), HTTP via `httpx.AsyncClient`, async LLM
  SDK methods. No `time.sleep` or `requests.get` in a request path.
- **FastAPI `Depends` for dependencies.** LLM client, DB session, embedding
  model, current user — all injected, not instantiated in handlers.
- **Lifespan for singleton resources.** DB engine, ML model (joblib),
  embedding model, LLM client — created once on startup, disposed on
  shutdown, exposed via `Depends()`.
- **Structured errors for external failures.** Every external call
  (LLM, tool API, webhook) has a timeout + retry-with-backoff + structured
  log. Tool failures inside the agent loop return as structured errors so
  the LLM can reason about them.
- **Webhook failure must not break the user response.** Fire-and-log; the
  user sees their answer regardless.
- **Update `CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md` after every major change.** Newest entry
  on top, plain language, explain *why*.
- **Commit after every stable milestone.** Conventional-commit style:
  `chore:`, `docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`.
- **Beginner-explainable code.** Prefer clarity over cleverness.

## 6. Current Day 1 status

- Backend shell exists (`backend/app/main.py`, `app/config.py`,
  `app/api/routes/health.py`, `app/api/routes/trip_briefs.py`,
  `app/schemas/trip_brief.py`).
- Frontend shell exists (Vite + React + TS, `App.tsx` rendering the four
  Decision Tension Board cards from a stub response).
- Docker Compose skeleton exists (db + backend + frontend, named `pgdata`
  volume).
- `GET /health` exists and returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
- `POST /api/v1/trip-briefs` exists and returns the hardcoded
  Madeira/Costa-Rica stub.
- `TripBriefResponse` schema exists and is the locked contract.
- Decision Tension Board UI exists (Dream Fit / Reality Pressure / Final
  Verdict / Counterfactual cards).
- Day 1 walkthrough exists at `docs/DAY1_CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md`.
- `backend/.env` is **not** tracked (verified). `backend/.env.example` is
  the tracked template.

**Day 2 status** — ML classifier shipped:
- `data/destinations.csv` — 131 hand-labeled rows, 9 features, 6 labels.
- `backend/app/ml/train_classifier.py` — Pipeline, 3 baselines, k-fold CV,
  GridSearchCV on RF, per-class report, joblib save.
- `backend/app/ml/results.csv` — every experiment logged.
- `backend/app/ml/model.joblib` — current winner: Logistic Regression at
  mean macro-F1 0.959.

**Day 2 status - RAG foundation shipped:**
- `data/knowledge/` - 28 markdown destination documents across 14
  destinations.
- `backend/app/rag/chunking.py` - markdown frontmatter parsing and
  900-character chunks with 150-character overlap.
- `backend/app/rag/embeddings.py` - deterministic local 384-dimensional
  embedding fallback plus a future real-provider interface.
- `backend/app/rag/ingest_documents.py` - local fallback ingest verification
  and Postgres/pgvector ingest path.
- `backend/app/rag/retriever.py` - top-k retrieval with DB-first/local-fallback
  behavior and three manual retrieval probes.
- `backend/app/schemas/rag.py` - Pydantic schemas for RAG tool input/output.
- `backend/app/tools/retrieve_destination_knowledge.py` - tool-shaped wrapper
  for the future allowlisted agent.
- `backend/app/db/` and `backend/app/models/` - async SQLAlchemy foundation,
  pgvector init logic, source document model, and chunk embedding model.
- Live Postgres/pgvector ingest is not yet exercised on this machine because
  Docker Desktop is not reachable (`dockerDesktopLinuxEngine` pipe missing).
  `backend/app/rag/smoke_test.py` verifies the deterministic fallback path.

**What is still missing**:
- LangGraph agent with the three tools (ML and RAG foundations exist, but the
  agent loop and allowlist are not wired yet).
- Two-model routing and token/cost logging.
- Full DB persistence for users, agent_runs, and tool_calls.
- Alembic migrations.
- Auth (register/login/JWT/`current_user`).
- Webhook delivery.
- Tests, linter, pre-commit, CI.
- LangSmith tracing.

The full status table lives in `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`.

## 7. Workflow for future Claude tasks

When given a new task, follow this order — every time:

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** (this file). It has the rules and the current state.
2. **Read `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`** to see what's TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE.
3. **Read `CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md`** (top entries) to see the most recent decisions.
4. **Make only the requested changes.** Do not redesign, refactor neighbors, or
   pre-build features for future days. If the user says "Day N only", respect
   it.
5. **Run relevant checks** when possible:
   - `git status`
   - `docker compose config` (compose syntax check)
   - frontend build (`npm run build`) when frontend changed
   - backend import / start when backend changed
   - training script when ML changed
6. **Fix only errors caused by the change.** Don't sweep the codebase.
7. **Update `CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md`** (newest entry on top) explaining what
   changed and why, in beginner-friendly language.
8. **Update `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`** if any status moved (TODO →
   IN_PROGRESS → DONE).
9. **Commit** with a conventional-commit message.
10. **Report** back to the user with: a short summary, commands run, what
    passed, what failed, and the commit hash.

When in doubt, ask.
